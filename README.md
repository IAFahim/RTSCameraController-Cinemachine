This project is a Camera Controller for RTS style games.
It works by adding the script to a Gameobject that is tracked by a Cinemachine Virtual Camera. 
The script controlls the Target and the Virtual Camera.

## Features
* RTS Style Rotation
* RTS Style Zoom
* RTS Style "WASD" Camera Movement
* RTS Style Mouse "Drag" Camera Movement
* UI Controller (Compas, Zoom Slider, Drag Images, Rotate Image)

## Requirement
* Cinemachine
* Old Input System

## How To Use
* IMPORTANT: Make sure you have installed the "Cinemachine" package before importing!
Delete the Camera from the Scene (If exists).
Place the "RTSCameraController" (located in the "Prefabs" directory) to your Scene.
That's all.
